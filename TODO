# TODO

- [ ] Replace all calls to `assert(â€¦)` with exceptions (or remove them
      alltogether)
- [ ] Once the first smoke-test fails, the subsequent tests fail with
      non-obvious error messages (somehow the token-list gets corrupted and
      remains that way for the subsequent tests)

## 2.0.0

- [ ] Remove all `// XXX: deprecated` operator aliasses from
      `src/Parser/Factory.php`
- [ ] Use `StudyPortals\Template4` as namespace (perhaps also lowercase the "P"
      in Studyportals?)
